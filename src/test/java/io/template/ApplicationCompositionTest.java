/**
 * Composition test: verifies that a small slice of the application
 * can be assembled and executed through the real dependency injection
 * and configuration layers.
 * <p>
 * General paradigm:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Use the same wiring mechanism as production (e.g., Guice modules) to obtain
 *       a fully constructed "top" component such as {@link Executor}.</li>
 *   <li>Still avoid creating real non-local resources (databases, AWS clients, etc.);
 *       those should be replaced with mocks or in-memory fakes in the test wiring.</li>
 *   <li>Keep the scope narrow: this is not a full end-to-end test, but a check that
 *       your object graph, modules, and high-level flow are coherent.</li>
 * </ul>

     * Example: overriding external dependencies in composition tests
     *
     * When you introduce external clients (e.g., StorageClient, KinesisClient),
     * you can keep this test pattern but replace those clients with mocks or
     * fakes instead of real networked implementations:
     *
     * The main concept to remember is - you do not want to be instantiating things that are non-local in unit tests.
     * They will likely just fail anyways, but if you happen to have the appropriate credentials cached somewhere
     * on your computer, it may accidentally execute important network calls and impact real data.
